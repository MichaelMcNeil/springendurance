    <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      After nearly a decade of post college weight gain, a News Years Resolution took me outside for a run.  It was a 30-second (uphill both ways) run that left me walking and deprived of oxygen. I won't soon forget that feeling. I had to change.
      <br>
      <br>
      Six months, some new eating habits, and regular running helped me drop 60 pounds (now down 80). My motivations expanded. I was no longer trying only to regain health or look better, but I loved the sport.
      <br>
      <br>
      I've set my sights on competing in triathlon at a high level, but running is my first love. Whether you're looking to perform at a higher level, or you want to make a lasting change to your health, I can help you hit your goals.

    <h1>TRAINING</h1>
      I am a Certified Running Coach with UESCA because UESCA takes training seriously. Certification is not a participation award, and training paradigms are grounded in extensive research. Without a solid foundation in science and physiology a coach can only prescribe training based on experience, or a guess.  UESCA helps coaches know WHY certain things work and certain things don't.
      <br>
      <br>
      "The UESCA certification is a robust, science-based certification that teaches the theory of exercise science and how it apply it to runners on an individual basis." - Rick Prince, UESCA Founder

    <h1>PASSION</h1>
      The inspiration for Spring Endurance was born out passion for the plant-based lifestyle.
      <br>
      <br>
      ðŸ’šðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿
      <br>
      <br>
      Newness. Vitality. Life. Growth.
      <br>
      <br>
      Spring is about channeling these associations through clean eating and living.
      <br>
      <br>
      Whether you are looking to support competitive training adaptations or increase your overall health, I can help you take steps in the right direction.

I'm passionate about people, data, and mobilization. I want to see others thrive, and I love finding cost-effective tech-solutions that increase productivity, comfort, and purpose. Understanding others and their needs is key.

Some things that make me "me"...

- _Nutrition and Fitness_: In 2018 I adopted a lifestyle that helped me shed ~70 pounds. Since then I've become an avid runner and swimmer. I'm planning to run 1,200 miles this year, race my first marathon, and my first swim-bike-run triathlon. <a style="display:inline-block;background-color:#FC4C02;color:#fff;padding:5px 10px 5px 30px;font-size:11px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;white-space:nowrap;text-decoration:none;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:10px center;border-radius:3px;background-image:url('http://badges.strava.com/logo-strava-echelon.png')" href='http://strava.com/athletes/30648228/badge' target="_clean">

- _Language_: I love language and linguistics. Proficient in Classical Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. Familiar with a random assortment of languages on [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/MichaelMcNeil52).

- _Church Leadership/Planting_: Between 2012 and 2018 I served in the pastorate. I started a collegiate ministry, directed a 300+ child sports program, and between 2016 and 2018 trained as a church planter.

- _Technology and Software_: I began a career in software before I pursued the pastorate working for large organizations like [H.P. Enterprise](http://hpe.com) and small startups like [Mavizon](http://mavizon.com). I've helped churches from 300 to 1,000+ be creative with technology.
