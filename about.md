    <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      After nearly a decade of post college weight gain, a News Years Resolution took me outside for a run.  It was a 30-second (uphill both ways) run that left me walking and deprived of oxygen. I won't soon forget that feeling. I had to change.
      <br>
      <br>
      Six months, some new eating habits, and regular running helped me drop 60 pounds (now down 80). My motivations expanded. I was no longer trying only to regain health or look better, but I loved the sport.
      <br>
      <br>
      I've set my sights on competing in triathlon at a high level, but running is my first love. Whether you're looking to perform at a higher level, or you want to make a lasting change to your health, I can help you hit your goals.

    <h1>TRAINING</h1>
      I am a Certified Running Coach with UESCA because UESCA takes training seriously. Certification is not a participation award, and training paradigms are grounded in extensive research. Without a solid foundation in science and physiology a coach can only prescribe training based on experience, or a guess.  UESCA helps coaches know WHY certain things work and certain things don't.
      <br>
      <br>
      "The UESCA certification is a robust, science-based certification that teaches the theory of exercise science and how it apply it to runners on an individual basis." - Rick Prince, UESCA Founder

    <h1>PASSION</h1>
      The inspiration for Spring Endurance was born out passion for the plant-based lifestyle.
      <br>
      <br>
      ðŸ’šðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿
      <br>
      <br>
      Newness. Vitality. Life. Growth.
      <br>
      <br>
      Spring is about channeling these associations through clean eating and living.
      <br>
      <br>
      Whether you are looking to support competitive training adaptations or increase your overall health, I can help you take steps in the right direction.
