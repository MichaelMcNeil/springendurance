# Aerobic Threshold Benchmarks

In progress....

# Anerobic Threshold Benchmarks (Ex. 1 Mile, 5k, 10k or 10, 30, 60 minute TT)

Tracking average pace for like distance or duration at near to above Anaerobic Threshold can help measure your aerobic endurance _(your ability to sustain power over time)_ and aerobic power _(your ability to produce power aerobically regardless of time)_. Your actual results are a combination of your aerobic and anaerobic abilities, but sessions of at least 10 minutes for untrainined individuals or 30 minutes for trained individuals help minimize the amount of anaerobic input. I prefer to look at this metric as a function of pace rather than completion time, because the confidence of average pace can be validated by correlating it with the range of minimum and maximum pace over the session.

**Goals**

- Increase the duration or distance of sessions as mastery of shorter sessions develop.
- Increase the average pace for sessions of like distance/duration, but...
- Minimize the range between minumum and maximum pace.

_For Example..._

Imagine a 30 minute time-trial where one athlete begins at 6 minutes/mile and steadily declines in pace to 8 minutes/mile throughout the session. He averages 7 minutes/mile (4.29 miles). A second athlete begins a 30 minute time-trial, she begins at 7:10 minutes/mile and steadily pushes herself to 6:50 minutes/mile at the end of the session. She averages 7 minutes/mile.

| Athlete | Duration   | Average Pace   | (Min - Max) Pace |
| ------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1       | 30 minutes | 7 minutes/mile | 2 minutes        |
| 2       | 30 minutes | 7 minutes/mile | 20 seconds       |

The second athlete shows more self awareness in pacing (which is a desireable skill to develop), and we also have more confidence that her average pace for the duration accurately reflects her current aerobic endurance. The first athlete showed less self awareness and likely had a greater anaerobic influence, which quickly depleted, making it more uncertain that his average 7 minutes/mile reflects an intensity that he can sustain for 30 minutes.

| Athlete | Outcomes                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | - Should continue to work on his self-regulation and body awareness <br>- Might focus on developing aerobic power to decrease reliance on anaerobic power                    |
| 2       | - Might increase the duration or distance of threshold sessions if it fits her goals <br>- Should increase the intensity of threshold sessions to accomodate her adaptations |

# Aerobic / Anaerobic Power Benchmarks

Benchmarking Aerobic and Anaerobic Power _(your ability to produce power)_ is best accomplished by measuring the distance completed of time-based repetitions or the average pace of distance-based repetitions. By decreasing the recovery interval between repetitions to 1:1 or less, your body's ability to rely on anaerobic systems for energy decline and more reliance from aerobic systems occur. To target anaerobic energy systems, a greater repetition:recovery-interval ratio should be used, such as 1:5.

> This is not a hard switch. At all intensities the body produces energy aerobically and anaerobically because all muscles function on an aerobic -> anaerobic spectrum. Ex. Type I (Slow) fibers are not completely aerobic, nor do they all have the same ratio of slow->fast myosin.

**Goals**

- Increase the duration or distance of repetitions as long as intensity > race pace can be maintained.
- Increase the average distance completed during time-based repetitions
- Decrease the average completion time of distance-based repetitions
- Minimize the range between minumums and maximums (consistency across repetitions).
- An increase in the rate of heart-rate recovery during the recovery intervals over like workouts.
- A decrease in the minimum heart-rate at the end of recovery-intervals over like workouts.

_For example..._

Athlete 1 and 2 both perform a 5 repetition x 1 minute workout with 1:1 intervals. Athlete 1 will have inconsistent intervals, where athlete 2 will be more consistent.

| Athlete | Rep-1 | Rep-2 | Rep-3 | Rep-4 | Rep-5 | Avg Distance | (Min-Max) Distance |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| 1       | 400m  | 300m  | 325m  | 410m  | 270m  | 341m         | 140m               |
| 2       | 335m  | 345m  | 350m  | 340m  | 320m  | 340m         | 30m                |

Athlete 1 shows a lack of self-regulation, and _possibly_ greater anaerobic ability than athlete 2 based on his high rep-1. Athlete 2 shows a strong competency for self-regulating over 1 minute 1:1 repetitions, and the ability to perform aerobically at this intensity, given the relatively short recoveries.

| Athlete | Outcomes                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | - Should continue to work on his self-regulation and body awareness <br>- Might focus on developing aerobic capacity and grow into his high power output |
| 2       | - Might considering programming that boosts, in this case, her aerobic power. (or anaerobic if this was closer to 1:5 recovery-intervals)                |
