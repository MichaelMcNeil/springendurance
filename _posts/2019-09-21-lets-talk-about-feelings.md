tl;dr - **It is useful to track not only your workout data, but also how you feel during training.**

A few days ago I was on the phone with a client. We were just connecting for a moment to handle some business, not to discuss training, but I was about a 3 minute walk from home and decided to connect on the previous days workout. This particular athlete is EXTREMELY disciplined at providing feedback after every workout (usually overall feeling, rpe, and some general comments), but for this workout no feedback was given and my take from the data was that it didn't go very well. He agreed, noting that he just "wasn't feeling it."

My gut told me this was a pattern, that over the last few higher intensity sessions he was having trouble shifting gears.

We've been working on building general fitness for a few months, and this last period we've started strengthening his endurance base - spending more time at about 95% MLSSv during significant workouts.
