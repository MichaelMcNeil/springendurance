As a runner, I always wonder if I'm prepared for an upcoming race. Are these shoes the right ones? Is my nutrition good? Am I hydrated well or did I hydrate too much? Did I do well for each training session? We do our best to prepare for the race, and we give our best on race day.

Training for my second marathon ([first marathon 3:54:12](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/60979/IndividualResult/QFgd?#U28590987)) was a complete eye opener. It opened my eyes to see that I am capable of so much more. This marathon, the Boston Bound Marathon (John's Creek, GA), is just the start. In the coming years, I plan to take my running to a whole new level - and inspire others to know they are capable of so much more.

# The Road

On the road to John's Creek, I knew something amazing was going to come out of me, but I was nervous too. The longest run I had finished in training was only 16 miles.

- Two weeks before the race, my mother died and my siblings and I were overwhelmed with the shock of a loved one's death and the logistics of funeral arrangements. A special thank you to everyone who helped us through this ❤️
- One week before the race, I began to feel very unwell. To make it through, I just held onto my faith in God and trusted that my training would carry me through.
- The night before the race, I was so excited. I had to force myself to sleep (lights off, phone off, everything off). I had the hotel clerk ring my room to wake me up at 3 am to toe the line by 5:30 am.

# The Race

That morning, I was certain something positive would come of my race. Someone asked if I planned to go sub 3:05, but knowing my training, I instantly replied "no". My only two goals were to run sub 3:30 and to cross the finish line going strong - my coach's race plan had me running 3:25.

I found another female runner planning a 3:29 marathon, and I started my race barely glancing at my watch, trying to keep pace with her. I started faster than I should have, but for the first 14-15 miles I was the number 1 female, which I never imagined I could do. It was around mile 15 @ 1:45 that my right ankle began to collapse - an ongoing issue that I'm working to overcome. I had to slow down.

Throughout my entire run, I never ceased in giving thanks to God. I knew it was by God's almighty grace, I'd complete the race happily and successfully.

At mile 16 or 17 this amazing female runner picked up her pace, lapping me at least twice, but I couldn't help but feel her positive energy as she remained focused and nailed a 3:09 finish. Over the final 2 1/2 miles, I steadily grew faster (crossing the finish at 6:33 min/mile) and grew happy - grateful to God and everyone who made this possible - finishing in 3:27:06. Special thanks to Stephanie, who aided my table during the race.

# The Reward

If I am honest, this Marathon wasn't decided until 3 months or so in advance. I had trained for 40 days with Michael McNeil as my coach when I got the idea. He inspired me to go further in my running dreams and I can not thank God enough for his impact on my running career.

Originally, I was trying to train for a 50-miler on my own and it just became tedious. I didn't know how to train for it, nor did I know what to expect. But after a few months of disciplined training, I realized I could actually be fast for my 50. I called up my coach and told him my plans. We agreed to look for a Boston Qualifying (BQ) marathon around early Sept to prepare me for the 50.

Not only did I BQ, but training for this race I gained a lot of confidence and learned new skills as a runner. I thank God for all of my friends, family and running family ([Paducah Area Running Crew](https://www.facebook.com/groups/275679196290211/) and [River to River Runners](https://www.facebook.com/River2RiverRunners/)) for being a part of my run experience. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world!
