    <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      After nearly a decade of post college weight gain, a News Years Resolution took me outside for a run. Six months, some new eating habits, and regular running helped me drop 60 pounds (found my racing weight after losing 80).  
      <br>
      <br>
      I love running. I love coaching. I love learning. I love finding new ways to analyze data. I LOVE helping other set and hit goals. Whether you aim to improve your body composition or <a href="/boston-bound-and-thankful" target="_blank">qualify for a world marathon</a>, I can help you get there.
      <br>
      <br>
      Personally, I'm really getting excited about triathlon, yet running is still my first love. I've got HUGE goals for next year! Feel free to ask!

    <h1>TRAINING</h1>
      I am a Certified Running Coach with <a href="https://coachendurancesports.com/" target="_blank">UESCA</a> because UESCA takes training seriously. Certification is not a participation award, and training paradigms are grounded in extensive research. Without a solid foundation in science and physiology a coach can only prescribe training based on experience, or a guess.  UESCA helps coaches know WHY certain things work and certain things don't.
      <br>
      <br>
      "The UESCA certification is a robust, science-based certification that teaches the theory of exercise science and how it apply it to runners on an individual basis." - Rick Prince, UESCA Founder

    <h1>PASSION</h1>
      The inspiration for the name "Spring Endurance" was born out passion for the plant-based lifestyle.
      <br>
      <br>
      ðŸ’šðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿
      <br>
      <br>
      Newness. Vitality. Life. Growth.
      <br>
      <br>
      Spring is about channeling these associations through clean eating and living.
      <br>
      <br>
      Whether you are looking to support competitive training adaptations or increase your overall health, I can help you take steps in the right direction.
