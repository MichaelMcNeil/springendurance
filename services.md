I'm passionate about people, data, and mobilization. I want to see others thrive, and I love finding cost-effective tech-solutions that increase productivity, comfort, and purpose. Understanding others and their needs is key.

Some things that make me "me"...

- _Nutrition and Fitness_: In 2018 I adopted a lifestyle that helped me shed ~70 pounds. Since then I've become an avid runner and swimmer. I'm planning to run 1,200 miles this year, race my first marathon, and my first swim-bike-run triathlon. <a style="display:inline-block;background-color:#FC4C02;color:#fff;padding:5px 10px 5px 30px;font-size:11px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;white-space:nowrap;text-decoration:none;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:10px center;border-radius:3px;background-image:url('http://badges.strava.com/logo-strava-echelon.png')" href='http://strava.com/athletes/30648228/badge' target="_clean">

- _Language_: I love language and linguistics. Proficient in Classical Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. Familiar with a random assortment of languages on [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/MichaelMcNeil52).

- _Church Leadership/Planting_: Between 2012 and 2018 I served in the pastorate. I started a collegiate ministry, directed a 300+ child sports program, and between 2016 and 2018 trained as a church planter.

- _Technology and Software_: I began a career in software before I pursued the pastorate working for large organizations like [H.P. Enterprise](http://hpe.com) and small startups like [Mavizon](http://mavizon.com). I've helped churches from 300 to 1,000+ be creative with technology.
