<p>As a runner, I always wonder if I’m prepared for an upcoming race. Are these shoes the right ones? Is my nutrition good? Am I hydrated well or did I hydrate too much? Did I do well for each training session? We do our best to prepare for the race, and we give our best on race day.</p>

<p>Training for my second marathon (<a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/60979/IndividualResult/QFgd?#U28590987">first marathon 3:54:12</a>) was a complete eye opener. It opened my eyes to see that I am capable of so much more. This marathon, the Boston Bound Marathon (John’s Creek, GA), is just the start. In the coming years, I plan to take my running to a whole new level - and inspire others to know they are capable of so much more.</p>

<h1 id="the-road">The Road</h1>

<p>On the road to John’s Creek, I knew something amazing was going to come out of me, but I was nervous too. The longest run I had finished in training was only 16 miles.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two weeks before the race, my mother died and my siblings and I were overwhelmed with the shock of a loved one’s death and the logistics of funeral arrangements. A special thank you to everyone who helped us through this ❤️</li>
  <li>One week before the race, I began to feel very unwell. To make it through, I just held onto my faith in God and trusted that my training would carry me through.</li>
  <li>The night before the race, I was so excited. I had to force myself to sleep (lights off, phone off, everything off). I had the hotel clerk ring my room to wake me up at 3 am to toe the line by 5:30 am.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-race">The Race</h1>

<p>That morning, I was certain something positive would come of my race. Someone asked if I planned to go sub 3:05, but knowing my training, I instantly replied “no”. My only two goals were to run sub 3:30 and to cross the finish line going strong - my coach’s race plan had me running 3:25.</p>

<p>I found another female runner planning a 3:29 marathon, and I started my race barely glancing at my watch, trying to keep pace with her. I started faster than I should have, but for the first 14-15 miles I was the number 1 female, which I never imagined I could do. It was around mile 15 @ 1:45 that my right ankle began to collapse - an ongoing issue that I’m working to overcome. I had to slow down.</p>

<p>Throughout my entire run, I never ceased in giving thanks to God. I knew it was by God’s almighty grace, I’d complete the race happily and successfully.</p>

<p>At mile 16 or 17 this amazing female runner picked up her pace, lapping me at least twice, but I couldn’t help but feel her positive energy as she remained focused and nailed a 3:09 finish. Over the final 2 1/2 miles, I steadily grew faster (crossing the finish at 6:33 min/mile) and grew happy - grateful to God and everyone who made this possible - finishing in 3:27:06. Special thanks to Stephanie, who aided my table during the race.</p>

<h1 id="the-reward">The Reward</h1>

<p>If I am honest, this Marathon wasn’t decided until 3 months or so in advance. I had trained for 40 days with Michael McNeil as my coach when I got the idea. He inspired me to go further in my running dreams and I can not thank God enough for his impact on my running career.</p>

<p>Originally, I was trying to train for a 50-miler on my own and it just became tedious. I didn’t know how to train for it, nor did I know what to expect. But after a few months of disciplined training, I realized I could actually be fast for my 50. I called up my coach and told him my plans. We agreed to look for a Boston Qualifying (BQ) marathon around early Sept to prepare me for the 50.</p>

<p>Not only did I BQ, but training for this race I gained a lot of confidence and learned new skills as a runner. I thank God for all of my friends, family and running family (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/275679196290211/">Paducah Area Running Crew</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/River2RiverRunners/">River to River Runners</a>) for being a part of my run experience. I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world!</p>
