</blockquote>

<p>tl;dr - To create training plans that support a desired, future performance, and in order to measure the ways in which those plans were successful/unsuccessful, coaches and athletes should regularly take metrics on contributors of athlete performance. Also, measuring an athlete’s fitness widely, and not only narrowly (at a single intensity), ensures balanced athletic development across the spectrum. Lastly, performance is key. Whatever improves performance the most is most important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disclaimer 2 - I’m currently developing an application and personal database for my athletes’ workouts to help inform my coaching decisions. These aren’t the only metrics that are important in creating a training plan, and metrics are only one factor of creating a plan. Further, these are the kinds of metrics that provide insight only after an athlete has been training regularly for some time. <strong>i.e. You shouldn’t use any of the below metrics in a vacuum.</strong></p>

<h1 id="aerobic-threshold-benchmarks">Aerobic Threshold Benchmarks</h1>

<p>It’s not a secret that easy, steady-state, aerobic training is valuable for all athletes - but how much - and how can you recognize progress - or lack thereof - from everyday gps and heart-rate data. It’s one thing to empiracally say, “I can run further now than I could 6 months ago.” It’s another thing to quantify, “what mixes and types of load produced the greatest aerobic developments during the last 6 months,” and then use that to maximize training adaptations in the future. To answer that question we have to actually track aerobic developments in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>I monitor this in two ways: one, I watch for improvements in pace at similar efforts governed by perceived exertion or training in a defined heart-rate zone. and two, I watch for decreases in ratio of pace:heart-rate between the first and second halves of a steady-state session, that is, aerobic decoupling. It’s commonly affirmed that a ratio with 5% or less variance shows a mastery for that particular intensity and distance. That is, the pace you maintain for the second half of your workout only varied in cardio-respiratory cost by 5% or less from the pace you maintained in the first half of your workout. Aerobic-decoupling can be a very valuable metric, but can easily be skewed by temperature, residual fatigue, and elevation.</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Increase the pace sustainable for efforts at aerobic intensities.</li>
  <li>Increase the duration or distance of long-runs as decoupling improves (~5% or less).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For Example…</em></p>

<p>Two atheletes go out and run 7.5 miles in 1 hour (8 minutes/mile). Let’s assume they each begin the run at 8:10 minutes/mile, and both climb at the same rate finishing at 7:50 minutes/mile. Fives minutes in, Athlete 1 and 2 each measure a heart-rate of 135. However, 35 minutes into the workout Athlete 1’s heart-rate climbs quickly to 175, while Athlete 2 stays mostly constant, finishing at 140.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Athlete</th>
      <th>Pace1 (min/mi)</th>
      <th>Pace2 (min/mi)</th>
      <th>AvgHr1</th>
      <th>AvgHr2</th>
      <th>Decoupling <br />(Pace1/Hr1 - Pace2/Hr2) / (Pace1/Hr1)</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>8:05</td>

      <td>138</td>
      <td>3.5%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Even though both the above athletes ran for the exact same time and distance, they got very different workouts. Athlete 1 is likely to be very fatigued after this effort, given the second half of the workout had a 17% higher cardio-respiratory cost than the first half. Athlete 2 probably felt no noticeable change in effort during this run and would likely rate it very easy - easy.</p>

      <td>1</td>
      <td>- Might not want to increase the duration of the run until decoupling improves <br />- Should not attempt this workout volume regularly, but rather use it as a long run</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>- Could easily use this effort as maintenance or even recovery <br />- Should consider an increase in pace for greater aerobic development during workouts of 1 hour</td>

<h1 id="anaerobic-threshold-benchmarks-ex-1-mile-5k-10k-or-10-30-60-minute-tt">Anaerobic Threshold Benchmarks (Ex. 1 Mile, 5k, 10k or 10, 30, 60 minute TT)</h1>

<p>Tracking average pace for like distance or duration at near-to-above Anaerobic Threshold can help measure your aerobic endurance <em>(your ability to sustain power over time)</em> and aerobic power <em>(your ability to produce power aerobically regardless of time)</em>. Your actual results are a combination of your aerobic and anaerobic abilities, but sessions of at least 10 minutes for untrainined individuals or 30 minutes for trained individuals help minimize the amount of anaerobic input. I prefer to look at this metric as a function of pace rather than completion time, because the confidence of average pace can be validated by correlating it with the range of minimum and maximum pace over the session.</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Increase the duration or distance of sessions as mastery of shorter sessions develop.</li>
  <li>Increase the average pace for sessions of like distance/duration, but…</li>
  <li>Minimize the range between minumum and maximum pace.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For Example…</em></p>

<p>Imagine a 30 minute time-trial where one athlete begins at 6 minutes/mile and steadily declines in pace to 8 minutes/mile throughout the session. He averages 7 minutes/mile (4.29 miles). A second athlete begins a 30 minute time-trial, she begins at 7:10 minutes/mile and steadily pushes herself to 6:50 minutes/mile at the end of the session. She averages 7 minutes/mile.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Athlete</th>
      <th>Duration</th>
      <th>Average Pace</th>
      <th>(Min - Max) Pace</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>30 minutes</td>
      <td>7 minutes/mile</td>
      <td>2 minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>30 minutes</td>
      <td>7 minutes/mile</td>
      <td>20 seconds</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The second athlete shows more self awareness in pacing (which is a desireable skill to develop), and we also have more confidence that her average pace for the duration accurately reflects her current aerobic endurance. The first athlete showed less self awareness and likely had a greater anaerobic influence, which quickly depleted, making it more uncertain that his average 7 minutes/mile reflects an intensity that he can sustain for 30 minutes.</p>

<h1 id="aerobic--anaerobic-power-benchmarks">Aerobic / Anaerobic Power Benchmarks</h1>

<p>Benchmarking Aerobic and Anaerobic Power <em>(your ability to produce power)</em> is best accomplished by measuring the distance completed of time-based repetitions or the average pace of distance-based repetitions. By decreasing the recovery interval between repetitions to 1:1 or less, your body’s ability to rely on anaerobic systems for energy decline and more reliance from aerobic systems occur. To target anaerobic energy systems, a greater repetition:recovery-interval ratio should be used, such as 1:5.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is not a hard switch. At all intensities the body produces energy aerobically and anaerobically because all muscles function on an aerobic -&gt; anaerobic spectrum. Ex. Type I (Slow) fibers are not completely aerobic, nor do they all have the same ratio of slow-&gt;fast myosin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Increase the duration or distance of repetitions as long as intensity &gt; race pace can be maintained.</li>
  <li>Increase the average distance completed during time-based repetitions</li>
  <li>Decrease the average completion time of distance-based repetitions</li>
  <li>Minimize the range between minumums and maximums (consistency across repetitions).</li>
  <li>An increase in the rate of heart-rate recovery during the recovery intervals over like workouts.</li>
  <li>A decrease in the minimum heart-rate at the end of recovery-intervals over like workouts.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For example…</em></p>

<p>Athlete 1 and 2 both perform a 5 repetition x 1 minute workout with 1:1 intervals. Athlete 1 will have inconsistent intervals, where athlete 2 will be more consistent.</p>

</table>

<p>Athlete 1 shows a lack of self-regulation, and <em>possibly</em> greater anaerobic ability than athlete 2 based on his high rep-1. Athlete 2 shows a strong competency for self-regulating over 1 minute 1:1 repetitions, and the ability to perform aerobically at this intensity, given the relatively short recoveries.</p>
