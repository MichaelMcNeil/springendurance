# Tools

To facilitate your journey you and your coach will utilize a tool called TrainingPeaks.
You'll use TrainingPeaks to receive training plans, provide feedback on workouts, and visually see your progress. You will also be responsible for uploading your GPS and heart-rate data (Your coach can help you).
Your coach will use TrainingPeaks to review that data and design personalized training plans to make sure you hit your endurance and wellness goals.
All athletes will receive a coach-paid upgrade to a [Premium Athlete account](https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204074014-Basic-vs-Premium-Athlete-Account-for-Athletes).

# Communication

A key to your success and a good coach/athlete relationship is communication. Your coach will design training plans and prescribe workouts based upon your goals, your schedule, and how your body responds to the program. Watches and heart-rate monitors can tell us a lot about the latter, sometimes more than we could express ourselves, but there is no substitute for the sharing that takes place between athlete and coach.
Texting, emailing, or calling are all appropriate, and your coach will get back with you as soon as reasonably possible.
New coach/athlete relationships will require the most attention as you get a feel for the conventions of one another.

# Expectations

**Expect to Grow.** Spring was founded with the dream that everyone should experience the joy of healthy living. For some it will be enough to make small nutritional changes and get active. Others will have a drive to perform at their very best, sacrificing to meet the demands of high-volume training.

**Expect to Set Big Goals.** Setting big goals is a catalyst to elicit big results. Weight loss and performance are often stunted by lack of planning. This leads to random training with random results. Take the long view. You are making changes for life! Where do you want to be in 6 months? Next year?

**Expect to Stick to the Plan.** What is often more overlooked than setting goals, is planning the steps to required to make them a reality. Your coach will help you set reasonable goals and build a plan to get there. This looks like 3 to 4 week periods, each with a set of benchmarks, and a plan to provide the necessary training adaptations to hit those benchmarks. It's crucial that you stick not only to the prescribed training, but also the prescribed rest.

But life does happen. You'll get sick. You'll work late. You're family will need you. Sometimes it rains... If you need to miss a workout, text, call, or email your coach. Your coach will then make a determination whether to cut the loss or make up the workout and adjust your schedule. PLEASE don't make-up workouts without consulting your coach. Overloading is a recipe for injury, and no sustainable way to build fitness.

**Expect to Give Feedback.** Since your training will be planned in 3 to 4 week periods its important that you notify your coach of upcoming conflicts (think family needs, work responsibilities, or travel). You should go into your TrainingPeaks calendar and add the days before your next training period is planned.
You should also provide regular feedback for your workouts. How did you feel? Did anything significant happen? Did you enjoy it? The "Post-Activity Comments" in TrainingPeaks is a perfect place to add these notes. Your coach will be notified when you do.

**Expect to Receive Feedback.**
At the end of each training period your coach will schedule a formal consultation. You'll receive feedback for the period being completed, and review your plan for the period upcoming. It's a good practice to be at your computer with your TrainingPeaks calendar open, so you can review major workouts and goals together. During these consultations your coach might investigate other areas related to endurance + wellness, such as nutrition or running dynamics. This is a great time for you to ask ANY questions.

# Billing

Depending on your level of fitness, goals, and current training season, you'll receive a new training plan during the last week of every training period for the following 3 to 4 weeks. At this point, your preferred method of payment will be charged at your contracted weekly rate. Payment processing is securely handled through Quickbooks.

# Preparing for your Initial Consultation

You can live a healthier, happier life. You are well on your way to hitting higher performance goals. As you get ready to meet with your coach for an initial consult, here are some things to think about.

**Goals.** Why do you train? What is driving you to make lifestyle changes?

**Lifestyle Factors.** What factors will compete with or limit your training capacity? Work? Family? Other hobbies?
